# README for Music Store Sales Data Analysis

## Introduction
This README provides a detailed overview of the SQL data analysis performed on a music store's sales database. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the complex data, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this analysis is to inform stakeholders (such as management, marketing teams, and inventory managers) about key findings related to music sales. By understanding customer behavior, popular genres, and sales trends, the music store can optimize its operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of several tables, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Artist**: Contains information about music artists, including their names and unique identifiers.
2. **Album**: Stores details about albums, such as album titles, release dates, and associated artists.
3. **Track**: Contains track-specific data, including track names, durations, and media types.
4. **MediaType**: Describes different media types (e.g., CD, digital download).
5. **Genre**: Provides genre information (e.g., rock, pop, jazz).
6. **Playlist**: Contains playlists created by users, allowing us to understand user preferences.
7. **PlaylistTrack**: Maps tracks to playlists, helping us analyze popular tracks.
8. **Employee**: Stores employee details (e.g., names, positions, hire dates).
9. **Customer**: Contains customer information (e.g., names, email addresses, countries).
10. **InvoiceLine**: Records individual invoice line items (e.g., track purchases).
11. **Invoice**: Contains overall invoice data (e.g., total amount, purchase date).

## Analysis Highlights

### 1. Artist and Album Insights
- Explored relationships between artists and albums.
- Identified popular artists based on album sales.
- Investigated whether certain artists consistently produce successful albums.

### 2. Track Analysis
- Examined track sales by genre and media type.
- Highlighted top-selling tracks.
- Analyzed customer preferences (e.g., do customers prefer longer or shorter tracks?).

### 3. Customer Insights
- Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior (e.g., frequent buyers, occasional buyers).
- Analyzed geographical distribution of customers to identify potential markets.
- Explored customer demographics (e.g., age groups, gender) if available.

### 4. Sales Analysis
- Detailed examination of invoices to understand sales trends.
- Identified peak sales periods (e.g., holiday seasons, special events).
- Analyzed factors contributing to increased sales (e.g., promotions, discounts).

## Tools & Technologies
- Utilized SQL for querying the database efficiently.
- Employed advanced querying techniques, including:
    - **Joins**: To combine data from multiple tables.
    - **Subqueries**: To retrieve specific subsets of data.
    - **Aggregations**: To calculate summary statistics (e.g., total sales).
    - **Window functions**: To analyze trends over time.
## Code Explained 
1) The first code calculates the total sales and the total number of invoices for each customer. It selects the customer ID, customer name, total sales, and the count of distinct invoices by joining the customer and invoice tables on the customer ID. It then groups the results by customer ID and name, orders them by total sales in descending order.

2) The second code identifies the customer with the highest total purchase amount. It selects the customer ID, customer name, and the total sales amount, groups the data by customer ID and name, orders them by total sales in descending order, and limits the output to only one row (the customer with the highest total purchase amount).

3) This code segments customers based on their purchasing behavior into categories like High Spender, Medium Spender, and Low Spender. It calculates the average amount spent by each customer and then categorizes them based on percentiles of average spending.

4) This code identifies the best-selling products in terms of revenue by selecting the track ID, product name, and total revenue generated from each product by joining the track and invoice_line tables on the track ID.

5) It categorizes products as either high-performing or underperforming based on their total revenue compared to the average sales across all products. It calculates the average sales and then categorizes each product accordingly.

6) It lists the top-selling genres by summing the quantity of tracks sold for each genre, grouping by genre name, and ordering them by the total quantity sold in descending order.

7) It identifies the top-selling artist by summing the quantity of tracks sold for each artist, grouping by artist name, and ordering them by the total quantity sold in descending order.

8) It determines the top-selling artist for each genre by summing the quantity of tracks sold for each artist within each genre, grouping by artist name, genre name, and track name, and ordering them by the total quantity sold in descending order.

9) This code analyzes sales revenue variation across different regions or countries by summing the total sales amount for each country based on the billing country from the invoices.

10) It calculates the number of customers who have made purchases in each country by counting the distinct customer IDs from the invoices table, joining with the customer table on customer ID, grouping by country, and ordering by the number of customers in descending order.

11) The last code snippet analyzes employee data. The first query finds the senior-most employee based on the hire date and job title. The second query calculates the total number of customers assigned to each employee to find the employee with the highest total number of customers assigned.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, popular music genres, artists, and overall sales trends. Stakeholders can use these findings to:
- Optimize inventory by stocking popular tracks and genres.
- Tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.
- Plan promotions strategically based on peak sales periods.
